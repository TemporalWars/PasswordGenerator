<p><strong>Password Generator Library</strong><br>
<br>
The password generator library, written in C#, is a simple assembly which allow generation of passwords with length anywhere from 1-99. The password generator has 4 character sets which a password can be generated from. The default 3 are 'Upper-Case Alpha',
 'Lower-Case Alpha' and 'Numeric'.<br>
<br>
The password generator assembly installs into the GAC and is automatically registered with Visual Studios 2010, allowing you to pick from the '.Net' references dialog window.<br>
<br>
The Interface is called 'IPasswordGenerator', which gives access to the 4 properties and 2 methods for generating a password.<br>
<br>
Initial testing shows you can create 995,000 passwords, using the batch parallel mode, in about 2800 ms.<br>
